            <li>
              <strong>Transparency:</strong> We show where answers come from
              (context snippets & sources). The assistant will avoid making
              claims that cannot be supported by the uploaded document.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User control & consent:</strong> You choose which PDFs to
              upload, and can remove or permanently delete them. We never use
              your documents to train shared models.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data minimization:</strong> We only store embeddings and
              minimal metadata needed for retrieval; we do not keep extra copies
              of uploaded files on the client UI.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Privacy & security:</strong> Access to stored data should
              be limited (server-side controls). Use encrypted transport (HTTPS)
              and secure API keys on the server.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Human oversight:</strong> AI answers are suggestions â€” not
              authoritative decisions. Always verify against the original
              document and consult a qualified human when necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Non-hallucination safeguard:</strong> The system prefers
              and cites explicit document context; when evidence is missing the
              assistant will say it could not find the information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accountability & feedback:</strong> Provide an easy
              mechanism for users to report incorrect or harmful outputs so the
              system can be improved.
            </li>

              Do not upload documents that you are not authorized to share.
              Confidential or regulated documents require additional controls.
            </li>
            <li>
              Verify important facts against the original document and external
              authoritative sources before acting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the &quot;remove&quot; or &quot;permanently delete&quot;
              actions when you no longer want a document retained by this app.

              If the assistant says it could&apos;t find an answer, try
              rephrasing the question or ask about a narrower passage (e.g., a
              chapter or heading).
